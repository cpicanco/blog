![GitHub Actions](https://github.com/cpicanco/blog/actions/workflows/jekyll.yml/badge.svg)

This site uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)!
 - it is awesome!
 - is a modified version of the [Clean Blog Template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) 

... And [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) too!
 - Emoji;
 - posts, layouts and includes examples;
 - post with GitHub markdown;
 - boolean multilanguange support (en/pt-br);
 - using `_data` for advanced Templating.
 - sitemap Template with multilanguage support;
 - Templating for Tags. Tag system compatible with GitHub Pages.
 - Templating for Pagination. Easy to use static Pagination system with no plugin or gems, compatible with GitHub Pages. Just push pages on demand and voilà:


```
# blog/language/page/1/index.html
---
index: 1
---
```

Also some work was done with:
 - Infinite scroll with [Waypoints](https://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/shortcuts/infinite-scroll/);
 - leave comments with [Disqus](https://disqus.com/);
 - Open Graph for image and description preview on Facebook;
 - Twitter Card from image and description preview on Twitter;
 - [Google OSE](https://www.google.com/webmasters/);
 - [Grunt Task Runner](https://gruntjs.com/);
 - using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) to compress images;

Finally, some [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) were used and some [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) as well. 

Next steps are:
 - lag work for a completely auto Pagination system :P
 - Load next post by clicking "read more" button; 
 - implement 'About' blog section;
 - explore grunt tasks;
 - move from Google Analytics to Piwik;
